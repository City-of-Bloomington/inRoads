	<h1>Requirements</h1>
	<h2>Web Server</h2>
		<p>This application will work with any web server capable of running PHP.</p>
		<h3><a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> (recommended)</h3>
		<dl><dt>SSL</dt>
			<dd>For security it is highly recommended to host the entire application
				over SSL.  PHP sessions are tracked using cookies, which if
				intercepted, are just as good as a user's password.
				Hosting over SSL minimizes this risk.
			</dd>

			<dt>mod_rewrite</dt>
			<dd>This application implements a FrontController patter. It relies
				on Apache's mod_rewrite to route all requests to
				<code>/public/index.php</code>
			</dd>
		</dl>
	<h2><a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> >= 5.3</h2>
		<p>This application relies on code features only found in PHP 5.3 and greater.
			In addition there are particulay PHP libraries that we rely on.  Make sure
			these are available in your PHP install.
		</p>
		<dl><dt>XML</dt>
			<dd>This extension is enabled by default in most PHP installations.
			<dt>Curl</dt>
			<dd>Web service and error reporting calls are implemented using curl functions.</dd>
			<dt>LDAP</dt>
			<dd>We support integrating with LDAP or ADS directories for user information
				and, if desired, authentication.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>General Configuration Notes</h3>
		<p>PHP needs the following ini settings that might differ from the default php.ini</p>
		<ul><li><strong>register_globals</strong>: off.  With PHP 5.3 this should be the default, but some hosts
				have it enabled.
			</li>
			<li><strong>error_reporting:</strong> This application is written to work with no errors
				with error_reporting set to E_ALL | E_STRICT.
			</li>
			<li><strong>arg_separator:</strong>To do valid XHTML strict, hrefs cannot be written
				with plain &amp;.  Rather than using entities, we chose to use the W3C recommendation
				of using the semicolon in all markup.  PHP can use both semicolon and ampersand
				when parsing url parameters.
				<ul><li>arg_separator.output = ";"</li>
					<li>arg_separator.input = ";&amp;"</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2><a href="http://dev.mysql.com">MySQL</a> (or an equivalent, such as
		<a href="http://mariadb.org">MariaDB</a>)
	</h2>
		<p>There are several drop-in replacements for MySQL.
			This application has been extensively tested with MariaDB.
		</p>
	<h2>Third Party Libraries</h2>
		<h3><a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a></h3>
			<p>This application uses a few features from the ZendFramework.
				You will need to download the ZendFramework and put it somewhere accessible by Apache.
				In our configuration, we'll point to wherever you've put it.
			</p>

		<h3><a href="http://yuilibary.com">YUI 3</a></h3>
			<p>The javascript for CRM relies on the YUI library.  Most production installs depend
				on external hosting for YUI, either from Yahoo or Google.  However, if you want,
				you can download YUI and host it yourself.
				In our configuration, we'll point to whatever host you're using for YUI.
			</p>
	<h2>External Web Services (optional)</h2>
		<h3><a href="http://www.jasig.org/cas">CAS</a> (Single Sign on)</h3>
			<p>For improved security, all City of Bloomington web applications in production
				are configured to use CAS for authentication.  This way, passwords never
				need to be stored in individual web applications and users only ever
				type their passwords into one website.
				If you have your own CAS server, you can configure CRM to do CAS authentication.
			</p>
			<p>You will need to download the phpCAS library from
				<a href="https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/phpCAS">
				https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/phpCAS</a>.
			</p>
			<p>CAS authentication can be disable by leaving it undefined in the configuration</p>

		<h3><a href="http://code.google.com/p/skidder/">Skidder</a> (External Error Logging)</h3>
			<p>In the City of Bloomington, we have a central web service, called Skidder, that all web applications
				report and errors to.  Skidder collects the errors, reports them to developers,
				and provides for browsing, slicing, and dicing the error reports.
				Direct notification to developers when errors occur is the best way to make sure
				bugs are fixed quickly.
			</p>
			<p>Skidder is open source and available at
				<a href="http://code.google.com/p/skidder">http://code.google.com/p/skidder</a>
			</p>
			<p>Skidder reporting can be left undefined in the confiuration not not desired.</p>
