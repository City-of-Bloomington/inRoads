	<h1>Install</h1>
	<h2>About this guide</h2>
		<p>These instructions focus on installing on a *nix machine with the Apache
			webserver.  If you are installing on Windows using IIS, you will need to
			do the equivalent steps for your environment.
		</p>

	<h2>Downloading</h2>
		<p>The latest stable release will always be available as a download at:
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-blossom">
			http://code.google.com/p/php-blossom</a>.
		</p>

		<p>If you want to live on the bleeding edge, new features and bug fixes take place in trunk.
			You can checkout the latest copy of the source code with the command:
			<code>svn checkout http://php-blossom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk</code>
		</p>

	<h2>Uncompressing</h2>
		<p>You can uncompress the tarball with the command (replacing "x.x.x" with
			your downloaded version number):
			<code>tar xzvf crm-x.x.x.tar.gz</code>
		</p>
		<p>You can then remove the tarball: <code>rm crm-x.x.x.tar.gz</code>

	<h2>Moving into place</h2>
		<p>You can move the directory anywhere accessible by Apache.  We'll be
			editing Apache's configuration to tell it where we've put the application.
		</p>
		<p>Apache will need read permissions for the application and write permissions
			for the data directory inside the application.  The easiest thing to do is just
			give Apache ownership of the application.
			<code>chown -R apache crm</code>
		</p>

	<h2>Apache Configuration</h2>
		<p>This application depends on mod_rewrite to rewrite all traffic to
			<code>/public/index.php</code>.
		</p>
		<h3>Example configuration:</h3>
		<code><pre>
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This Virtual Host config is intended to redirect all traffic from
# the unencrypted versions of the application to the encrypted version
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameVirtualHost *:80
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
	Redirect /application https://localhost/application
&lt;/VirtualHost*gt;
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alias /application "/var/www/sites/application/public"
&lt;Directory "/var/www/sites/application/public"&gt;
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /application
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule .? /application/index.php [NC,L]
&lt;/Directory&gt;
		</pre></code>

	<h2>Configuration</h2>
		<p>This application comes with an empty configuration file called
			<code>configuration.inc.default</code>.
			The default file must be copied and the new file given the correct name,
			<code>configuration.inc</code>.
			You will need to run through the new <code>configuration.inc</code> and
			provide values for all the settings listed.

	<h2>Verify installation</h2>
		<p>At this point, you should have the application installed on the webserver.
			With the configuration.inc in place, you should be able see the application
			in your browser.  Point your browser to whatever URL you chose in your Apache
			configuration and make sure the page loads with no errors.  Your should see
			something like this:
		</p>
		<div>
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/freshInstall.png" alt="Screenshot of a fresh installations" />
		</div>


	<h2>Create an Administrator account</h2>
		<p>At this point the application is completely empty and ready to start using.
			The rest of the setup will continue in the browser at your new site.
			However, you need to create the initial user account for you to log in with.
			This will need to be an Administrator account so it has permission to do
			all the rest of the setup.  More administrators can be created as needed
			using the web interface.
		</p>
		<p>In your application install directory is a PHP script that can create user accounts.
			<code><pre>
include '../configuration.inc';

$person = new Person();
$person->setFirstname('firstname');
$person->setLastname('lastname');
$person->setEmail('email@example.org');

$person->setUsername('username');
//$person->setPassword();
$person->setAuthenticationMethod('Employee');
$person->setRole('Administrator');

$person->save();
			</pre></code>
			Once it's been modified, you'll need to run it from the command line.
			<code>php scripts/createPerson.php</code>
		</p>
		<p>Once the <code>createPerson.php</code> script has been run, you should be
			able to log into the site using the account information you just created.
		</p>
