	<h1>LDAP</h1>
		<p>LDAP (and ADS) can be used for authentication and for importing user details
			during account creation.
			To enable LDAP support, you'll need to edit <code>configuration.inc</code>
		</p>
		<p>Uncomment the DIRECTORY settings in <code>configuration.inc</code> and provide
			values for your LDAP or ADS directory.
			The Employee class is written to expect the inetOrgPerson schema.
			If you are using a different schema in your LDAP directory, you may need to
			customize the code in <code>libraries/framework/class/Employee.php</code>.
		</p>
		<h2>Employee LDAP configuration</h2>
			<p>DIRECTORY_USER_BINDING will substitute {username} with the username the user
				provides.  For authentication, ADS servers typically
				need to bind as username@domain.name, whereas LDAP servers typically
				only need to bind using the raw username.
			</p>
			<p>This application will bind as DIRECTORY_ADMIN_BINDING when doing lookups of user
				information during user account creation and editing.
			<h3>LDAP-style configuration example</h3>
<pre><code>
define('DIRECTORY_SERVER','ldaps://example.org:636');
define('DIRECTORY_BASE_DN','ou=people,o=ldap.domain.somewhere');
define('DIRECTORY_USERNAME_ATTRIBUTE', 'uid');
define('DIRECTORY_USER_BINDING','uid={username},'.DIRECTORY_BASE_DN);
define('DIRECTORY_ADMIN_BINDING', 'uid=admin,'.DIRECTORY_BASE_DN);
define('DIRECTORY_ADMIN_PASS','password');
</code></pre>
			<h3>ADS-style configuration example</h3>
<pre><code>
define('DIRECTORY_SERVER','ldaps://example.org:636');
define('DIRECTORY_BASE_DN','OU=Department,DC=example,DC=org');
define('DIRECTORY_USERNAME_ATTRIBUTE', 'CN');
define('DIRECTORY_USER_BINDING','{username}@example.org');
define('DIRECTORY_ADMIN_BINDING', 'admin@example.org');
define('DIRECTORY_ADMIN_PASS','password');
</code></pre>
		<h2>Authentication</h2>
			<p>User accounts have a property called "authenticationMethod".  The only
				method enabled by default is "local".  Local users are authenticated by
				comparing the password they give with the SHA encrypted password in the database.
				When a user attempts to login with an LDAP authentication method, such as Employee,
				CRM will attempt to bind to the directory as the user to verify their password.
			</p>

		<h2>Account Creation</h2>
			<p>Only Administrators are allowed to create or edit user accounts for people.
				When creating or editing a user account, you can choose from the available
				authentication methods.  Local as well as any custom methods will be listed in
				the drown.
			</p>
			<p>When a user is saved with a custom authenticationMethod, this application imports
				any missing personal information from the LDAP directory.  This means, once
				you have an Employee LDAP set up, you can add users to the system by just
				providing their username and any roles you want to assign them.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Employee user accounts are not created automatically</strong> on login.
				Employees must be added manually by an Administrator.
