This directory is for overrides to the Template files.

If you want to customize a particular template, mimic the directory structure
from /templates.  The system will use templates found here first, instead of
using the template from the application.

For instance, if you want to customize the banner, you would create
/data/templates/html/partials/banner.inc

It might be easiest if you work from a copy of the original template file.
