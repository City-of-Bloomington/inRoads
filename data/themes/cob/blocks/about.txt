This directory is for overrides to the Block files.

Blocks are files that contain partial HTML for including into the overall
Template files.

If you want to customize a particular block, mimic the directory structure
from /blocks.  The system will use blocks found here first, instead of
using the block from the application.

It might be easiest if you work from a copy of the original block file.
